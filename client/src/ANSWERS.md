- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    Only Class component used to have state and all the lifeCycle methods.
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    Constructer - Give birth to the application and get stored in the memory
    componentDidMount - Mounts the application to the actual dom and can store SideEffects such as api call
    componentWillUnmount - UnMounts the app from the dom and delete, clean up the memory of unnecessary events.
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    Custom hooks gives you ability to use same code over again and be dynamic also helps the code to be DRY.
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
    As application code gets bigger it gets more complex and hard to find the bug. So if we implement the test in our code in the early stages it will easy to maintain.
